          <p>My work as a general contractor informed my decision to pursue a degree in software engineering.

              There are many parallels between being a skilled construction worker, and a software engineer, which I am always happy to talk about at length. But in the name of being clear, concise, and hopefully not cliche,
              I will keep it short, and bulleted.
              <ul>
                  <li>
                      Having all of the tools accessible to solve a problem, but being short some amount of understanding, is exciting to me.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      The extent to which carpentry and remodel skills can be mastered is truly fascinating, I am usually less than content when I do not feel like a beginner.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      I enjoy the process of taking a vision of some intimidating goal, and sectioning it into managable portions, which are enjoyable in their own sense to complete.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      A home, much like any given computer program, is only as valuable as it is able to meet the clients needs, I cherish this irony.
                  </li>
              </ul>
                Hope you enjoy these photos.
