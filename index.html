          <h3>Carpentry:</h3>
          <div>I have been a self-employed general contractor since 2016.</div>

          <div>There are many parallels between being a skilled carpenter and a software developer, which I am always happy to talk about at length.</div>
          <div>In the name of clarity I will keep it short, loose and bulleted:</div>
          </p>
              <ul>
                  <li>
                      Having all of the tools accessible to solve a problem, but being short some amount of understanding, excites me.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      The extent to which carpentry and remodel skills can be mastered is truly fascinating. I am less content when I do not feel like a beginner.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      I enjoy the process of taking some intimidating goal, and sectioning it into managable portions, which are enjoyable in their own sense to complete.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      A home's value is determined by how closely it meets a client's needs, I enjoy this challenge.
