          <p>I have been self-employed as a general contractor since 2017.
             My work as a general contractor informed my decision to pursue a degree in software engineering.

              There are many parallels between being a skilled construction worker, and a software engineer, which I am always happy to talk about at length. But in the name of being clear,
              I will keep it short, loose and bulleted.
          </p>

                  <li>
                      Having all of the tools accessible to solve a problem, but being short some amount of understanding, excites me.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      The extent to which carpentry and remodel skills can be mastered is truly fascinating. I am less content when I do not feel like a beginner.

                  <li>
                      I enjoy the process of taking some intimidating goal, and sectioning it into managable portions, which are enjoyable in their own sense to complete.

                  <li>
                      A home, much like any software program, is only as valuable as it is able to meet the clients needs, I cherish this irony.
