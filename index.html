        <div>
            I graduated from the University of Delaware in 2017 with a degree in Management Information Systems and a minor in Economics.
            I am currently pursing a degree in Software Engineering with Harvard Extension School.

          <h3>Career:</h3>
          <div>I have been self-employed as a general contractor since 2017.</div>

          <div>There are many parallels between being a skilled construction worker and a software developer, which I am always happy to talk about at length. 
          <div>In the name of clarity I will keep it short, loose and bulleted:</div>
          </p>
              <ul>
                  <li>
                      Having all of the tools accessible to solve a problem, but being short some amount of understanding, excites me.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      The extent to which carpentry and remodel skills can be mastered is truly fascinating. I am less content when I do not feel like a beginner.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      I enjoy the process of taking some intimidating goal, and sectioning it into managable portions, which are enjoyable in their own sense to complete.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Much like any software program, a home's value is determined by how closely it meets the customers needs, I enjoy this challenge.
